# Tryst

A Java compiler to convert Tryst code into RISC-V assembly. Tryst is my own custom language. The purpose of this project is not to solve any specific problem, and Tryst is not really useful for anything (at time of writing this, it's not even Turing complete), but I enjoy working on it in my free time.

## Why 'Tryst'

I chose the name Tryst for three reasons:
1. It has a certain ring to it.
2. I quite like the .try file extension, which as far as I can tell is not used by anything else.
3. The word 'tryst' means 'a private, romantic meeting,' and the language itself my personal labor of love.

## The Language

When developing the syntax and behaviour of Tryst, my philosophy is to ignore established programming conventions and choose syntax that would be intuitive to a first time learner. This philosophy, admittedly, is often overwritten by my desire to implement language features that I think are interesting or funny.
